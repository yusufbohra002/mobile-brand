<p>Many iPhones bought through a monthly carrier contract are SIM locked, restricting their use to one particular carrier.[116] While the iPhone was initially sold in the U.S. only on the AT&T network with a SIM lock in place, various hackers found methods to bypass that SIM lock.[117] More than a quarter of first-generation iPhones sold in the U.S. were not registered with AT&T. Apple speculated that they were likely shipped overseas and unlocked, a lucrative market before the iPhone 3G's worldwide release.[118][119] Today, many carriers either remove the SIM lock automatically after a certain period, or do it upon request, either for free or for a small fee.[120] iPhones bought from Apple are not SIM locked.[116] Many carriers also sell the iPhone unlocked when purchased outright rather than on a long-term contract.</p>
